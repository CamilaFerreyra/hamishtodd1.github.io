	Notes
		These animations- you must make them using the system, the player is to reverse-engineer them
		Nice how videoing them projects them onto a plane so they can be vizzed in a volume
		Tech
			Mocap markers are cheap! https://mocapsolutions.com/collections/mocap-solutions-markers
			You probably need a high speed camera
		All the multivectors coming from the pictures should stay inside the animation, no need to have a clone of them in the scope
		so you're modelling the differential apparently
		A better representation of a thing over time might be its worldline with timestamps labelled
		the basis vectors should be inside the scene
		is there an elegant way to feed back into the scene?
			the "real" ones are frozen in place, when you click them they're cloned
		The thinking is: you are trying to go from t = a to t = a + epsilon
			This tries to avoid numerical analysis. That might be impossible / foolish
		Maybe you're always modelling the time evolution of something in which case it's a simple number as input.
		But "reaction to different parameters and events" is interesting which is why getting the differential between two frames may be more versatile
		Properties of ideas
			Should be "satisfying" stuff. Look at "most satisfying video"
			Juicey
			Look to Rhythm Paradise for inspiration
			you want to put random things in the littlescene. That's how you make cool demoscene stuff
			It should mostly be about mechanics to be a fun easy thing for people to do in their lives with AR
				Look through mechanics textbooks for examples
