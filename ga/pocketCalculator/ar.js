	Probably aim at adults, people you know. And then, kids miiiight like it. That's probably what minecraft did?
	Make it for yourself
	You know so little about multiplayer design beyond articulate. Keep it simple I guess...
	People should share levels with each other, you just need to know where they've left them. In museums for example

	Could even replace clothing, cabbiboos face thing taken to extreme
		The new color scheme from M&S; it is a mapping of curvatures and positions to colors
		People need things based on their own interests, sold specifically to them or the tiny community they are in
		Responds to dances
	But also sports/games, frisbees/sport/fighting; glowing weapons (geometric primitives)
		Throw virtual frisbee into goal
		Whip each other
		Make guns, trebuchets, bullets that corkscrew
		Whip
		Kids making semi realistic laser guns with limited resources?
		Swooshy veil behind sword
	Toys
		It's not just about your body, you can fill your room up, put beads on your door, whatever
		Put the thing your kid made on the fridge
		Attach them to things, annotate
		"VR UI" becomes precisely "how to make the toy I want"
	Videos
		Friend does dance, you try to model their dance
		Speed, slow etc
		People make little things out of lego? Cogs?
		Input from audio?
	tech
		Want the masses of things too really
		Just wait for hardware dude
		Oculus controllers!
		Detect edges
		put a dot or QR code on things
		Rigid bodies: can deduce from 3 vectors on it. On the other hand some things are squishy. People should make their own rigid body stuff
			Legos and cogs are rigid bodies
		Plastic things that you, Hamish, make and sell
			You can have a (rigid) handle and the handle has a small attachment that you can rotate or telescopically extend
