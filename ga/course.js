	separate camera for "asides"
		History
		Verbal jokes
		Larger practical demonstrations?

	To demonstrate equality you can just plot things. Or you could use omega calculus to reduce to 0

	Put hand in leap motion area, hand is large over the text editor, lets you pick stuff with small movements

	Why would Johannes Kepler be a good janitor? Because he doesn't mind sweeping out the same area every day

	Without sound or particle effects or AR, just you talking in zeimlight style with PowerPoint slides, it can be the best academic course in GA available.

	Hit all the things you usually would

	Call course:
		Well really you should make it then name it right?
		"Applied mathematical physics", "applied geometric algebra"
		“3D math” or “applied geometry”
		“geometry for computer scientists/physicists”
		"geometric physics"
		Something that says “this is practical/related to physics, and also fundamental maths”. Ideally it’s something people seek out that has not been claimed yet

	Hololens 2, camera fixed in place, "transparent screen"
		When you touch one of them they get pushed in in a springy way

	Is there a way of communicating to people that this is the only way things could be?
		Probably not, games don't work that way, it's not necessarily a question everyone is interested in anyway
		The algebra rules tell you "this is the only way it could be", that the whole thing drops out of simple manipulation rules. That's philophically/psychologically/mathematically interesting. And possibly you cannot cover it.


	Wanna be able to move between powerpoint and game easily

	Set exercises from the thing.
	Need some "prove that" mechanism I guess
