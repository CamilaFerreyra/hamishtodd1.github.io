	Without sound or particle effects or AR, just you talking in zeimlight style with PowerPoint slides, it can be the best academic course in GA available.

	Setup
		So that there is resistance when drawing and touching
			Panel of glass
			Stylus and somehow machine knows when end is touching surface
		Hololens 2, camera fixed in place, "transparent screen"
			When you touch a "symbol" it gets pushed in in a springy way
			Put hand in leap motion area, hand is large over the text editor, lets you pick stuff with small movements
		separate camera for "asides"
			History
			"Why did you have to bring maths into it?"
			Verbal jokes
			Larger practical demonstrations?
			Why would Johannes Kepler be a good janitor? Because he doesn't mind sweeping out the same area every day
			History

	Proving stuff
		To demonstrate equality you can just plot things. Or you could use omicron reduction to reduce to 0
		Proof by contradiction? Could put a dumb thing into the omicron reduction and, haha, look for bugs
		Is there a way of communicating to people that this is the only way things could be?
			Probably not, games don't work that way, it's not necessarily a question everyone is interested in anyway
			The algebra rules tell you "this is the only way it could be", that the whole thing drops out of simple manipulation rules. That's philophically/psychologically/mathematically interesting. And possibly you cannot cover it.

	Syllabus
		Look at Geometric Algebra for Physicists
		QC
		PGA
		Urgh, Steve vs Eric Lengyel. Should probably chat with Eric
		Why neg times neg = pos? neg sends you in opposite direction
		Conformal/GTG... hear them out

	Call course:
		Well really you should make it then name it right?
		"Applied mathematical physics", "applied geometric algebra"
		“3D math” or “applied geometry”
		“geometry for computer scientists/physicists”
		"geometric physics"
		Something that says “this is practical/related to physics, and also fundamental maths”. Ideally it’s something people seek out that has not been claimed yet
