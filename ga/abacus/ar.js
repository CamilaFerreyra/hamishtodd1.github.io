	Chris: I am going to have people walk around with ar and put vectors in the world that will be input as an array. Masses too. From three vectors on a rigid body I can get its rotor I guess. Need to label masses though. What are the fundamental labels from which other things can be derived?

	Footage of cycle stunt people going through the air. Sell to RT software

	These things could even replace clothing, cabbiboos face thing taken to extreme

	You were fairly anxious about having real and imaginary axes overlap X and y. But both turn some amount when you actually use them so people know not to take their setup seriously

	Possibly this will enthuse people more than your own ideas for levels ever could

	put a dot or QR code on things

	Detect edges

	Friend does dance, you try to model their dance

	Speed, slow etc

	Could be done on a normal phone for god's sake

	Some CV stuff may help you anyway, if you use footage

	Regid bodies only

	With Joan. Train a neural net, extract the bivector

	People make little things out of lego? Cogs?

	The best CV thing is of course the oculus controllers

	You can have a (rigid) handle and the handle has a small attachment that you can rotate or telescopically extend
	And sell the things

	Probably aim at adults, people you know. And then, kids miiiight like it. That's probably what minecraft did?
	Make it for yourself

	The kinds of things you make must look cool no matter what
		Glowy whip

	Input from a song, or audio around you?

	Maybe you should have an "origin mode" where all vectors are situated at an origin
		the moment in the animation where the vectors are given the same origin is important. The origin is there all along!

	Looooot of people (kids) for their little games are going to want vr UI. So this is a not inconsiderable goal. Little toys

	You want to be in AR and fill the world with these things, attach them to things, annotate

	People need things based on their own interests, sold specifically to them or the tiny community they are in. So the dancing/appearance thing does make sense
