		The teacher can make a presentation, import whatever they like
		There's a set of webpages, not just one per lesson but one per exercise
		you copy their links, "teacher links". The server detects that someone is accessing a teacher link and flicks the student webpages to that

	Facilitate a real conversation between 1 person and many
		Would be nice to have a thing above every kid's head saying how they're doing
		Kinda want the teacher to choose win/loss conditions. They don't get "how well you did", they just get your answer
		Teacher could make sure that a non-troublemaker wins the competitions?
		Teacher sets a puzzle they all try to do it, one who gets it has their solution recorded and shown on the master? Or theyâ€™re superimposed?
