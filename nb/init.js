/*
	The "context"
		Slides.net
			The teacher can make a presentation, import whatever they like
			There's a set of webpages, not just one per lesson but one per exercise
			you copy their links, "teacher links". The server detects that someone is accessing a teacher link and flicks the student webpages to that

	If a kid's computer crashes, they should instantly be returned

	Would be nice to have a thing above every kid's head saying how they're doing

	Kinda want the teacher to choose win/loss conditions. They don't get "how well you did", they just get your answer

	Facilitate a real conversation between 1 person and many

	The goal is to get them to invent the terms themselves

	Teacher could make sure that a non-troublemaker wins the competitions?

	Teacher sets a puzzle they all try to do it, one who gets it has their solution recorded and shown on the master? Or theyâ€™re superimposed?
