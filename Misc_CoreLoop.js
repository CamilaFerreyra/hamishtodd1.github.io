/* EGW TODO
 * Some nice material? Needs to have normals updated
 * Shadows on irreg; a "floor" for the shadow
 * Screen shake on QS? Need that for the sound effect to make sense
 * 
 * Camera zooms in and out on CK (this could be after new version)
 * Separate version, Pictures on the side
 * The irreg grabbers want outlines
 * 
 * -------------Before illustrator
 * Cel-shaded erythrovirus
 * shadow for irreg
 * Put things on corners of irreg and QS?
 * Round the edges of the corners on CK
 * ------------With illustrator
 * Hire them to illustrate the cell, that is their job description
	They illustrate it in a way that is compatible with the other kinds of pics you know you'll have
 * Better viruses on all (maybe CK things are shut)
 * QS colors, CK colors, irreg and button colors
 * Highlight the pentagons and hexagons on polio and hepatitis B when you say it (just make pics with different colors and fade) 
 * Location of lights in boca
 * Writing underneath viruses
 * 2XFC or 1F15 for T=3. Wait what about cowpea?  for Not very straight lines but that might be ok if it's consistent across others
 * How to make nice pics of viruses: 
 * 	Chimera
 * 	clear out the things you don't want 
 * 	multiscale models, resolution 0 (i.e. surfaces)
 * 	if you want to color a chain, select one copy of it and click copies in the multiscale models window
 * 	actions>color>all options>tools>surface color>radius>get color person to choose
 * 
 * -------------Further "animating" (and probably miscellaneous things)
 * Lots of stuff moving around. It creates dynamism, have that whenever you can
		Fade to virus pictures at end of all chapters
 * 		Zoom in on darb e pattern
 * 		Yes, this is better with VR stuff! Think about it in the moment, tighter creative loop, easier
 *		"These are images of some other viruses" is a series of 8 that fade in
 * irreg trying different configurations for algorithm
 * boca quaternion responds to moving the assembly toy
 * models go haywire at the end
 * Show the closed irreg capsid when you're trying to make phi29? ;_;
 * Camera closer on beginning of CK
 * better music? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnfpsvS2AA8
 * Bug: full screen youtube crap, if you double click then jesus. Prevent fullscreen?
 * 	-the button flashes until you have opened AND closed it, with a change between
 * 	-cite pictures
 *  -loading screen. You may need to stagger inits
 *  -break up all the chapters into separate videos WHEN INTEGRATING NEW VIDEO
 *  -space out the video and canvas a bit
 *  -get a person with a sense of color to look at everything, including the pics of HPV, polio and hepatitis - Ario?
 *  -watch people a lot and tweak the zooming and rotating code, just because it is simple doesn't mean that it is good
 *  -If webgl doesnï¿½t load (or etc), recommend a different browser or refreshing the page
 *  -slight change to cues for "boca"
 *  -bifuricate for the touchscreen. Put QS in correct orientation so it looks like HPV
 *  -proteins don't appear in nucleus?
 *  -tree selector fades in and no sticky out bits
 *  -all the effects in camerastuff
 * Could bring in disco ball, radio dome, gazebo/tent, dymaxion map at bottom, golf ball islamic art and greenhouse obv, origami
 * New pics. Correct sizes and give them a border, then resize in the scene.
 * Make use of the "now you can choose the next virus" clip and repeats
 * 		Loop back over every button press advice
 * Fading pics. Probably the thing to do is to specify actual chapters that consist of a fade?
 * CK pentagons flashing like sirens
 * Solid hexagons and pentagons?
 * Touch
 * Loading screen
 * 
 * 
 * ----------------No internet:
 * -pentagons in demo
 * -Mouse doesn't flick things to the wrong quaternion when you come into the frame from the video
 *  	Something like: if the new mouse position is on that side, set both old mouse position and new mouse position to that
 * -no 666s, you don't want pearl-clutchers. Easiest is change it to 665, -1, 999?
 * -everything listed in CKsurfacestuff, bocavirus, quasisphere, youtube stuff. There isn't much.
 * -make it work in different resolutions/respond to resize. Snap to 480/720/1080
 *  	-mouse position responds to resize?
 * -Test with a low framerate to see what it's like and chase down remaining framerate dependence
 *  
 *  
 * --------Technical
 *	Optimize loading
	-minify?
 *  -if the canvas isn't running, halt the video
 *  -upload static version to youtube and link to that if page doesn't load
 *  -make sure a good picture appears when shared on facebook and twitter
 *  -make it feel good
 *  	-optimize http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_performance.asp
 *  		-profile
 *  		-could generate some things once, then not again
 *  		-search for missing "console.log"s, those are old debug things and may have wasteful ifs, alexandrov is chock-a-block
 *  -test on different setups
		-Johan's Mac
		-Reidun's computer (probably just webgl)
 *  -Change to another domain / mask it?
 *
