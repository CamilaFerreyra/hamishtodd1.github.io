	Need to show matching first. Order is random

	Should be able to adjust number of people

	Sim shows all the agents

	Nice to have
		Post-match complexity, which may be influenced by

	Here's the proposition: you have someone who is "ugly".
		We can choose to keep showing them to people until they have been swiped right on a bunch

		Title: how much are online dating apps screwing us?
		These people have a lot of power. They are influencing society, they are influencing race relations
		First they meet see pics in random order and no stratification
		Stratification slider, with symbols on either end. Maybe oval on side vs upright?
			"Gini coefficient?"
		The thing that is important is what keeps you using the app - these things will be tweaked in order to satisfy you
		Conclusion
			We need a law saying that these algorithms have to be open source
			We ideally want a law saying that data must be published, after some anonymization
			Or hey maybe you don't want to see your stats
