    Zeimlight feature:
        Drawing should be compatible with zoom
        moving pictures
        drawing. Do it on huawei laptop, can use touchscreen

    Molecular bio viz
        Probably best done by proper animators?
        Whole human cell, friggin colossal. Maybe also next to a human hair?
        Can have some wobbling
        A virus attached to it. Probably a simple SDF
        The spike is the important thing. If you can get a wobbling surface and a few moving around in there then that's compelling

    regeneron REGN3048-3051
        getting the real antibodies (why not S230? Probably wouldn't work well)
        moderna mRNA 1273
