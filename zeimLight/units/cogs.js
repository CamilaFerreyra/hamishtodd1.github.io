background shouldn't be boring black, make it like that demoscene dude's lectures

cogs could have some visual character? rust, chipped teeth, patterend holes, handle on one, windmill on another?

make animated gifs of all of them

Simply do it as a tumblr post.

Would be kinda awesome if you could morph things. truncated cuboctahedron to truncated icosidodecahedron

Script:

Question: how can we arrange equally-sized cogs so that they are able to turn?

[have some pictures]

General principle: Cogs that touch one another must go in opposite directions.

[have a line of five cogs, red yellow red yellow]

Suppose we wish to have arrangements of cogs that close up.

[the five cogs try to turn into a pentagon but there is chafing. We add another cog, allowing the creation of a hexagon]

Therefore we require cogs to be arranged around polygons with an even number of sides.

[square, octagon, dodecagon. Maybe concentric]

We ask: "what can be made with even-sided polygons?"

Answer: some cool patterns, and some 3D shapess that deserve a bit of love!

Unless we want different-size cogs, we are talking about archimedean solids

[cube. From now, writing appears below pics] Easy start: here the cogs are place on the corner of a cube

[truncated octahedron] the shape that is implied by these cogs is a "truncated octahedron". [writing disappears, is replaced by the following] Note that the cogs are arranged around hexagons and squares.

[truncated cuboctahedron] This one is made of squares, hexagons and octagons. It's called a "truncated cuboctahedron", but if you look it up you'll see that that's a rather misleading name for it.

[truncated icoisdodecahedron] Now we're onto squares, hexagons and decagons. The natural thing to do now is to go onto squares, hexagons and dodecagons...

[Great rhombitrihexagonal tiling] But when we bring those shapes together, we get a flat pattern rather than a solid. This is the "Great rhombitrihexagonal tiling"...

[Truncated square tiling] ...and this is really the only other interesting tiling.

[decagonal prism] There are some other solids we can make. This is a boring example, a "decagonal prism". [replace with hexadecagonal prism] You can also have arbitrary prisms (duh)

[rhombic tricontahedron] Here the cogs are on the corners of diamonds, so we can make this "rhombic tricontahedron". Sometimes 3 diamonds meet at a corner, sometimes five.

[rhombic dodecahedron] And here we have a rhombic dodecdahedron, which has a similar principle. Fun fact: rhombic dodecahedrons can tesselate 3-space!

[truncated rhombic dodecahedron] This is a rhombic dodecahedron with six corners cut off and replaced with squares, a "truncated rhombic dodecahedron".

With rhombuses, in theory you should be allowed to have six meet 

(here we have limited ourselves to shapes where a cog touches at least three other cogs)
