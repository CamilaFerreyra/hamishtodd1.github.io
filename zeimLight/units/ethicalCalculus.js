	No one can disagree:
		Some situations are worse than others => single number is outputted

	you multiply the horribleness of a chore by time spent doing it

	You can add and remove people

	Suffering is the opposite of happiness?

	Some people need more resources to be happy? Eh, start with utility functions, just control people's happiness directly

	Old:
		Information-theoretic morality. You can’t judge someone for not acting on information they don’t have. If the information they have tells them that gay people should be murdered, you cannot judge them for saying “gay people should be murdered”. Indeed they are admirable for saying it =/
		“Utility funtion” = “score”, almost by philosophical definition. I wonder whether there’s a Cox’s theorem for morality? Cox’s theorem shows that our intuition that some events are more plausible than others has a unique mathematical description. Some intuitions: some acts are more evil than others; an evil act done twice is twice as bad as done once. But a one in six chance of killing six people is better than a certainty of killing one person
		A new approach to morality taking chance into account. Assume modal realism: if you took a risk with a 10% chance of killing 10 people, and it was fine, actually you should still go down for the death of one person. This should be written into law immediately
		Ethical calculus, negavprefutilitarianism. Utility monster gets happiness pumped into him. We all do ethical calculus, because safety
