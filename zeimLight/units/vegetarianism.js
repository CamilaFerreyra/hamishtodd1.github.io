/*
	Mathematical proof that you should not eat meat (a graph)

	You, your disabled kid, a pig
	You're on an island. There are pigs and there is fruit

	how many of you there are
	how many of you can choose to eat meat
	The output that concerns you is how many starve
	How much meat you eat - flexatarianism is good!

	In real life, they're not disabled, they're just poor

	Could stratify people
		In a world of abundance, all can have meat
		If more want meat than can get it, those at the top get it
