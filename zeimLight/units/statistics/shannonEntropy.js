/*
	we have a bunch of probabilities... a spectrum... many of them have probability 0
	On top of them is the nlogn curve
	You can increase the probability of a given point which gives you the place on the line

	total probability = 1
		therefore, simplex, and extra dimension!

	More interesting is 3 variables:
		S = log(x)/x + log(y)/y
