	Without sound or particle effects or AR, just you talking in zeimlight style with PowerPoint slides, it can be the best academic course in GA available.

	Hit all the things you usually would

	Hololens 2, camera fixed in place, "transparent screen"
		When you touch one of them they get pushed in in a springy way

	Is there a way of communicating to people that this is the only way things could be?
		Probably not, games don't work that way, it's not necessarily a question everyone is interested in anyway
		The algebra rules tell you "this is the only way it could be", that the whole thing drops out of simple manipulation rules. That's philophically/psychologically/mathematically interesting. And possibly you cannot cover it.


	Wanna be able to move between powerpoint and game easily

	Set exercises from the thing.
	Need some "prove that" mechanism I guess
