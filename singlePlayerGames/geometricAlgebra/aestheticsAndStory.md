	Hearthstone may be an inspiration
	DO NOT THINK ABOUT THIS
	Liquid should glow. Spelunky's is great
	Maybe have the whole scene in perspective. The things come towards you to do the operation
	How about it all happens on a desk
		On the sand at the Academy in ancient greece
		At Newton's desk in Cambridge university
		A desk at NASA in the 60s with a mainframe in the background
		At the LHC, with others surrounding you
		On a space station in the future
		In the middle of a quasar
	SDF/raytrace
		Can at least consider it because the geometry of these objects, which the player will spend a lot of time looking at, is simple
		good shadows, reflections, colored lighting, transparency. Lights could originate in a texture.
		But mostly can think of stuff as being in the background. Leave that to a game engine?
		So anything that is more complicated gets an an sdf https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/intersectors/intersectors.htm
		Lights come from environment/cubemap
			Ideally one with XHR and all that. Maybe even a light field? Could just be a cylindrical one?
		Ray tracings

	Cubemap "background"
		Each pixel of which gets its own ray trace/sdf call, just the one to see if it is immediately accessible to the light
	Maybe you want a conventional thing
		Less time consuming, makes it so you can focus on what is important
		The frogs are a certain animation
		Particle systems
		Look dumbass, of course when you bring in an artist they'll want to put in non-mathematical shit with textures etc.
	Examples
		hell https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MdfGRX
		clouds https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XslGRr
		Stateless fight

Story
	Invention of i
		Euler's identity is surprising only if you don't know GA; only if you haven't fully internalised that maths is statements about shapes
	Personalities
		Tait was an astonishing asshole who should not be allowed to win
		The story of Clifford's wife is quite beautiful
		Very atheist
		He was in favor of divorce of something? Deffo read chapter in "Science Serialized: Representations of the Sciences in Nineteenth-Century"
		Pro sex work?
		It is a great story. Hestenes looking back on it as ancient wisdom
		Clifford on his deathbed thinking the hope will probably die and people will be doing hacky shit forever
		Tait was evil, full of wishful thinking and idiotic faith. Hating of divorce and secularity, everything  Clifford wasn't. Kicking a man while he was dying
	Those areas Kepler talked about, they are bivectors!
