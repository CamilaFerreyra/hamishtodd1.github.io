Justification
	Ticks boxes for your game design aesthetics
		Leveraging people's geometrical intuition
		An area of maths/physics where the system invovles specific, interesting objects with specific, interesting collision-rules
		The idea of negative area and length is a nice balance of intuitive and surprising, and makes total sense in this context (no other?)
		A way in to special relativity AND QM, which are metaphysically awesome
		An exercise in making a propaganda piece, in trying to change a bunch of stuff
			Of all topics, games are most easily suited to maths...
			and while it's all well and good to try to educate people, it's not very impressive if it's just something you'll hear in a undergrad anyway
		This is about elegantly building up sophisticated models from minimal elements - the powerful thing that systems running on a computer can do
		And this is equivalent to the usual argument for GA: many things from your education don't come out of nowhere/aren't arbitrary:
			length
			sin and cos
			complex numbers
		Both understandable to the public and really quite sophisticated - it is a gift that scientists need this explained to them
	AR/video thing
		Genuinely useful for computer graphics, mechanical engineers
		Seeing mathematical structure in the world around you
		Generally thinking abstractly
		But the stuff you're modelling will be reeeeeally familiar and visible from real world/daily life. Shows people what applied maths is
	As a tool for thinking/example of a programming language:
		Better than Human Resource Machine, no symbols, things actually are what they represent
		All functions have two inputs
		It's an example of an algebra / group, very deep
	You can use it to make algorithms yourself for VR UI and pretty animations
	"Directness"
		One of the first things you have to learn in applied mathematics is one of the most difficult things: imagining an abstraction
		You have to be able to take these real-world things like mass values and images in your head of real things and turn them into algebra
		Then be, at all times, extremely able to *remember* which algebraic symbols correspond to what
		This removes at least one layer
		Similar to the fact that you don't mind having long variable names

Target audiences / marketing
	People studying physics
		Undergrads
			Could go on physics/maths podcasts
			Could go on rationallyspeaking - it is interesting to have a genuine disagreement in mathematics
				https://xkcd.com/2028/
		Masters/PhD
		PIs - go to conferences
		Youtube videos
	People who like indie games
		GMTK discord
		Thinky puzzle discord
		Good graphics
		Good trailer
	Schoolkids
		Do some scientific studies and put it in Times Education Supplement
		Could try to communicate their marks will be improved
		"Pre-physics" "physics prep"

Story
	Personalities
		Tait was an astonishing asshole who should not be allowed to win
		The story of Clifford's wife is quite beautiful
		Very atheist
		He was in favor of divorce of something? Deffo read chapter in "Science Serialized: Representations of the Sciences in Nineteenth-Century"
		Pro sex work?
