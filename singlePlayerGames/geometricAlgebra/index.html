Target audiences / marketing
	People studying physics and engineering
		Undergrads
			Could go on physics/maths podcasts
			Could go on rationallyspeaking - it is interesting to have a genuine disagreement in mathematics
				https://xkcd.com/2028/
			Explanation videos using the system as a marketing method
				Be aware, marketing should be scalable if you're calling it marketing
		People about to do undergrad may be WAY better
		Or people who finished a while ago and want to try out the maths again but understand this funky different way of doing it
		Masters/PhD
		PIs - go to conferences
		Probably lots of rocketry is best for marketing in terms of examples
		Might be good to build up a buffer of videos
		And fuck it, pay 3b1b etc for a mention
	People who like indie games
		In egw presentation, after some crazy products, it can be a funny anticlimax that vector plus scalar is boring
		Let's players
		GMTK discord
		Thinky puzzle discord
		Good graphics
		Good trailer
	Schoolkids
		Take it to actual schools. Newbattle, ELSS, Graveney. Can give them a talk in exchange for letting the kids play
		All schoolkids learn sin and cos. That is your first experience of this stuff
		Do some scientific studies and put it in Times Education Supplement
		Could try to communicate their marks will be improved
		"Pre-physics" "physics prep"
		The "real life" thing is what'll go a long way
	Clickbaity titles
		"The cross product is wrong"
		"How to visualize quantum computing"
		"Breaking bitcoin with quantum computing"
		"How to visualize special relativity"
