Justification
	Ticks boxes for your game design aesthetics
		Leveraging people's geometrical intuition
		An area of maths/physics where the system invovles specific, interesting objects with specific, interesting collision-rules
		The idea of negative area and length is a nice balance of intuitive and surprising, and makes total sense in this context (no other?)
		A way in to special relativity AND QM, which are metaphysically awesome
		An exercise in making a propaganda piece, in trying to change a bunch of stuff
			Of all topics, games are most easily suited to maths...
			and while it's all well and good to try to educate people, it's not very impressive if it's just something you'll hear in a undergrad anyway
		This is about elegantly building up sophisticated models from minimal elements - the powerful thing that systems running on a computer can do
		And this is equivalent to the usual argument for GA: many things from your education don't come out of nowhere/aren't arbitrary:
			length
			sin and cos
			complex numbers
		Both understandable to the public and really quite sophisticated - it is a gift that scientists need this explained to them
	AR/video thing
		Genuinely useful for computer graphics, mechanical engineers
		Seeing mathematical structure in the world around you
		Generally thinking abstractly
		But the stuff you're modelling will be reeeeeally familiar and visible from real world/daily life. Shows people what applied maths is
	As a tool for thinking/example of a programming language:
		Better than Human Resource Machine, no symbols, things actually are what they represent
		All functions have two inputs
		It's an example of an algebra / group, very deep
	You can use it to make algorithms yourself for VR UI and pretty animations

QM
	a vector of complex numbers can separate into a vector and bivector (i*vector) parts?

Aesthetics/non-design
	But mostly can think of stuff as being in the background. Leave that to a game engine?
	If it's all simple gemetric shapes (cylinders, cones, some flat surfaces) you can get explicit ray intersections -> good shadows, reflections, colored lighting, transparency. Lights could originate in a texture.
	So anything that is more complicated gets an an sdf https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/intersectors/intersectors.htm
	And it ends up on an environment/cubemap. Ideally one with XHR and all that. Maybe even a light field? Could just be a cylindrical one?
	Mmmm, can't really combine them

Marketing
	Imagine this
	Could go on physics/maths podcasts
	Could go on rationallyspeaking - it is interesting to have a genuine disagreement in mathematics

	Personalities
		Tait was an astonishing asshole who should not be allowed to win
		The story of Clifford's wife is quite beautiful
		Very atheist
		He was in favor of divorce of something? Deffo read chapter in "Science Serialized: Representations of the Sciences in Nineteenth-Century"
		Pro sex work?
