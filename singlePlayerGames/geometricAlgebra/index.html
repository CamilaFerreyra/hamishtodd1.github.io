Justification
	Ticks boxes for your game design aesthetics
		Leveraging people's geometrical intuition
		So many EEs cannot be made into full games because the quantitative result is a one-off
			To justify something big you need a really rich area, such as programming (Human Resource Machine), 4D (Miegakure)
		An area of maths/physics where the system invovles specific, interesting objects with specific, interesting collision-rules
		The idea of negative area and length is a nice balance of intuitive and surprising, and makes total sense in this context (no other?)
		A way in to special relativity AND QM, which are metaphysically awesome
		This is about elegantly building up sophisticated models from minimal elements - the powerful thing that systems running on a computer can do
		And this is equivalent to the usual argument for GA: many things from your education don't come out of nowhere/aren't arbitrary:
			length
			sin and cos
			complex numbers
		Both understandable to the public and really quite sophisticated - it is a gift that scientists need this explained to them
	AR/video thing
		Genuinely useful for computer graphics, mechanical engineers
		Seeing mathematical structure in the world around you
		Generally thinking abstractly
		But the stuff you're modelling will be reeeeeally familiar and visible from real world/daily life. Shows people what applied maths is
	As a tool for thinking/example of a programming language:
		need to speed up programming
		Maybe the way of helping the world is to help already-smart people
			the rest maaaaay be a lost cause and we should focus on developing tech for them
		Better than Human Resource Machine, no symbols, things actually are what they represent
		All functions have two inputs
		It's an example of an algebra / group, very deep
	You can use it to make algorithms yourself for VR UI and pretty animations
	An exercise in making a propaganda piece, in trying to change a bunch of stuff, using the power of puzzles and no words
		Of all topics, games are most easily suited to maths...
		and while it's all well and good to try to educate people, it's not very impressive if it's just something you'll hear in a undergrad anyway
		Many give up on the idea of changing anything
		You manage to get them while they're young
	In maths there is the problem of "problem solving" - can you take the maths you've learned and recognize when it's useful, turn the real into the symbols? Often no. This "put vectors etc on top of footage" is the best way to address that
	"Directness"
		Symbols suck, have them be real. They CERTAINLY suck as a first introduction to things
		One of the first things you have to learn in applied mathematics is one of the most difficult things: imagining an abstraction
		You have to be able to take these real-world things like mass values and images in your head of real things and turn them into algebra
		Then be, at all times, extremely able to *remember* which algebraic symbols correspond to what
		This removes at least one layer
		Similar to the fact that you don't mind having long variable names
	Get 'em with AR shit, keep em with the quantum. It's the breadth
	The applications-profundity link is better with this project than any other. You get real mechanical engineering things (read some mech eng...) that anyone can appreciate and show their unity
	Can you persuade people that QM and SR is a natural extension of the maths of what they already know?

Target audiences / marketing
	People studying physics and engineering
		Undergrads
			Could go on physics/maths podcasts
			Could go on rationallyspeaking - it is interesting to have a genuine disagreement in mathematics
				https://xkcd.com/2028/
			Explanation videos using the system as a marketing method
				Be aware, marketing should be scalable if you're calling it marketing
		People about to do undergrad may be WAY better
		Or people who finished a while ago and want to try out the maths again but understand this funky different way of doing it
		Masters/PhD
		PIs - go to conferences
		Probably lots of rocketry is best for marketing in terms of examples
		Might be good to build up a buffer of videos
		And fuck it, pay 3b1b etc for a mention
	People who like indie games
		Let's players
		GMTK discord
		Thinky puzzle discord
		Good graphics
		Good trailer
	Schoolkids
		Take it to actual schools. Newbattle, ELSS, Graveney. Can give them a talk in exchange for letting the kids play
		All schoolkids learn sin and cos. That is your first experience of this stuff
		Do some scientific studies and put it in Times Education Supplement
		Could try to communicate their marks will be improved
		"Pre-physics" "physics prep"
		The "real life" thing is what'll go a long way
