Justification
	This is about elegantly building up sophisticated things from minimal elements
	Levereging people's geometrical intuition
	It is about seeing mathematical structure in the world around you.
	GA is good because the things don't come out of nowhere, you see that they are emergent
		sin and cos come out of nowhere in your education too
	This is way better than Human Resource Machine, no symbols, things actually are what thtye represent
	Maybe this is even useful for you programming stuff?
		What the hell are summed bivectors?
		Trivector times bivector is presumably vector. 
		Trivector times trivector is presumably bivector.
	The idea of negative area and length is a nice balance of intuitive and surprising, and makes total sense in this context (no other?)
	You do want to model familiar, visible things in the real world, using this separate mathematical realm. That is applied maths.
	It is an exercise in making a propaganda piece, in trying to change a bunch of stuff
		Of all topics, games are most easily suited to maths...
		and while it's all well and good to try to educate people, it's not very impressive if it's just something you'll hear in a undergrad anyway
	Apparently it lets you cover special relativity and QM soooo
	This is one set of visualizable *objects* with specific, interesting collision-rules
		Both objects and rules are deeply important in the world
	Gets people to think abstractly about real stuff that they know they need to think about
	Also it's a useful example of an algebra / group / lambda calculus 
		All functions have two inputs
