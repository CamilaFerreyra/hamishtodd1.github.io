/*
	normal game such as VVVVVV (this is probably the way to do it; communication cometh after):
		walk through a space. Start point and desired endpoint
		There are parts you cannot go through, you will bump against them
		There are parts which if you hit them you will die
		The bad parts might be moving

	Could have some levels where things are more limited, only two kinds of rotation, eg RP2, eg you see a little creature connected to a thing


	You can think of the group elements as orientations, or as rotations from your current state

	The sphere, cylinder, and subgroup thing should be communicated
