	Surfaces editing game

	If you drag it in the direction of the gradient it "expands" or "retracts"
	"No constants / linears allowed"?

	The proposition is: some set of "interesting" surfaces
	that are good when you translate and orient a point on their surface

	We are picturing a point on S2, like it doesn't react if your hand rotates around surface normal
	Maybe it should though. Let's say it has a chequered surface and you're rotating the mapping

	Specific ideas
		The sphere whose surface also passes through the origin
		The plane

	Deffo do stereographic projection first
