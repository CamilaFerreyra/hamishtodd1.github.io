/*
	Surfaces editing game

	A set of bezier patches. You can control their tangent planes at corners and fix them together.

	If you drag it in the direction of the gradient it "expands" or "retracts"
	"No constants / linears allowed"?

	The proposition is: some set of "interesting" surfaces
	that are good when you translate and orient a point on their surface

	We are picturing a point on S2, like it doesn't react if your hand rotates around surface normal
	Maybe it should though. Let's say it has a chequered surface and you're rotating the mapping

	Specific ideas
		The sphere whose surface also passes through the origin
		The plane

	Deffo do stereographic projection first

	Look you have to be empirical, the point is to think of it all as temporary

	One strategy to find all elements of fundamental group: you know you won't get crosses
