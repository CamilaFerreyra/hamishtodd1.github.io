	If you were to organize everything, how would you do it?
		Beauty of mathematics - beautiful applicable maths, phase space/dynamical systems, geometric algebra
		Physics - thermodynamics, QM, phase space and approximations, special relativity
		Epistemology - Jaynes, Shannon,
		Metaphysics - Godel, Tegmark, Aaronson
		Morality - utilitarianism, empiricism coming from bayesian, simulation
