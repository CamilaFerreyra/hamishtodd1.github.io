	Group	Acts on		Manifold st point = element		Can be broken up into sets looking like...	Such that all the elements in a set preserve	...and therefore the base space is
	SU(2)	R3 / C2		S3								S1s											The "axis", a 1D subspace						S2
	SE(3)	R6 / C3		Something 8D, unusable			S3s											Another 1D subspace?							S5

	If a fish wanted to think a little about the structure of SU(2);
	equipped with a visualization of three colored points moving on lines, depicting the xyz of some points on a sphere,
	The fish could choose one of the sets of points
	And do some rotating. The xyz of the grabbed point wouldn't change; they'd be exploring one of the S1s in the hopf fibration

	The ordinary way that the fish preserves a subspace, with the projection, is to go over to that projected point and grab and rotate around it
		Which corresponds to choosing a subspace


	So fish wants to understand hopf fibration (not necessarily its 3D stereographic projection!)
		It explores S2, eg chooses a hopf circle by moving around a stereographic projection of S2
		Fibers do group together into clifford toruses. Could alternate between circles and that.
		The connection to SO(4) is coincidental, there is no equivalent for SU(3), so forget about that
			But the idea of choosing a stabilizer, eg a point in the base space, makes sense
			It's a metaphor, but not an exact mapping
			The hopf fibration is a visualization of the structure of rotations that is appreciable to a 3D creature, that is nice
			But don't think that it's real. T
		It grabs a point to preserve (=a 1D subspace of R3) and then explores that circle by rotating
		Is there some nice way to explore S5? you have 6dof. And then it's quite easy to move around S3, a mere 3-dof
		It might even have points projected from S2, and little circles
			But you have to choose how many circles, eg probably choose some discrete subgroup
		an advantage it has is that the base space has as many dimensions as its universe
			2d creature tries to understand s2 vs 3D understand S5
			Where are the numbers for these base spaces coming from?
				2 = 
				5 = 3*2 - 1
			sooo, not allowed stereographic projection
		So no, the fish is not going around a stereographic projection this time
		It has a square slice and a slider... jeez though, it's only looking for a 1D subspace, so wasteful

		Maybe need both hands somehow

		Linelander learns about 3D orientations?
			It has 2 views of the sphere in patches that are at right angles

			It can go forwards and it can choose to stop and continuously change direction
			This allows it to get the sphere to any orientation? Bit surprising!
			It is on S2. Can only go in 1 direction
			When it grabs, it rotates 90 degrees, so now it is rotating around the point it grabbed
			So it can

		What about icosahedron <-> hexacross?


	Once you've found the point to stabilize, you "explore the three sphere" by just rotating, of course



	Interesting visualization would be hopf fibration morphed to S2xS1 thing you had in mind

	Another reason not to be surprised: physics clearly motivated some breakthroughs in maths, this is the head-and-head argument you make.
	Differentials
	quaternions
	symplectic geometry
	Maybe riemannian geometry because he thought space might be curved?

	The fuck is the lie algebra of something?
