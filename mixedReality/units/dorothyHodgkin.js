	Hodgkin, Thatcher, Skywalker, and diabetes"

	Need pdb reader, contouring, zooming. Ideally you can put them side by side and see difference easily
	Her amazing drawings

	Intro
		She directly saved the lives of tens or hundreds of millions of people, indirectly billions
		First person to do biological crystallography
		Oxford Professor, Nobel prize
		one of the first women to get a first class degree
		have a video of a nice growing crystal
		An incredible scientist who was a woman (and an attentive mother to three kids) IN THE THIRTIES
		"Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin" because she held out for a long time against taking her husband's name for twelve years; she took it under pressure from a publisher.
		Left wing: adviser to Marxist prime minister of Ghana
		Married a communist
		Campaigned a lot against nuclear proliferation
		Married to a communist
	Structural biology
		Her penicillin thing looks great, have that
		The stuff in epipens
		First medically relevant protein
		Three decades
		https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/14 insulin
		http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/194 designer insulin
		pig insulin being a bit different, show the structure
		And the pictures of the awesome models. And data!
		GMO made it cheaper and more humane
		The thing about a part being chopped off
	Thatcher
		amazing student, a young woman with humble origins
		We know Thatcher (then Roberts) admired Dorothy enormously, and was an enthusiastic chemist
		Angela Merkel chemist connection
		She delivers on her potential, first woman prime minister
		1987, awarded the order of Lenin, which she went behind the iron curtain to collect
		It is amazing to me that the BBC has not done a drama about this
	Luke Skywalker
		She likes you so much she has a portrait of you in her office
		but using her position to do everything Dorothy saw as evil?
		Reducing funding for public education; deregulation, tax cuts; nuclear proliferation
		And with what she did to [X], it's fair to say she turned her back on Hodgkin's ideas of how. I mean feminism!
		Imagine being Dorothy, the person who did all that for politics, and then your student is literally Margaret Thatcher
		At some point the idea was floated that she could be on the Â£50 note
		I would most certainly be in favour of that
		Britain is incredibly well represented amongst structural biologists, and amongst early feminists
		Whenever they were going to meet, Thatcher would read up on recent discoveries in chemistry
		There's something very British about the idea of two extremely influential political people...
			sitting and talking about chemistry
