Gender tracker

Made for my own use, but maybe some others will find it useful.

I've gotten a bit concerned about the gender makeup of people speaking at discussions of various kinds. There's lots of evidence out there to suggest that it is skewed in favor of men, but I wanted to be able to be, shall we say, scientifically anecdotal!

There are *all sorts* of reasons why a person might or might not want to speak out in a discussion. I certainly don't want to say that if your discussion scores badly on this then there must be some sexism at play.

However, there are reasons you might want to record this. You might use it if you're chairing a discussion and deciding which hand to pick, for example. My own situation is this: I am an opinionated man, and I can find *something* to say in almost any discussion! Often I'll choose not to say it because it might not be interesting enough - so I have a threshold of interesting-ness. But there are other things that have an effect on that threshold, and one of them is who else has spoken in the discussion so far.

Let me say it again: I don't think that a discussion that scores badly with this thing is necessarily a sexist discussion. In particular, I CERTAINLY don't think that any particular man in any particular discussion that scores badly is a sexist man. I believe that sexism is internalized: women have been socialized to speak out less, and often (though not always) they will have a low threshold


TODO (maybe) change "man" to "priveleged person" or whatever. Could have a different version
