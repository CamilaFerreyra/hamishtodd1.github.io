<h1>Teaching resources</h1>

<p> Hello!</p>
<p>First, I'm glad you enjoyed the presentation and you want to spread this stuff around.
I taught maths for a while and I believe that this is great mathematics teaching material - it is applicable and it is beautiful!</p>

<h3>"What's the most worthwhile information for my students to know about virus patterns?"</h3>
Of the information you see in my documentary, the "hepatitis" chapter is, in a sense, the most important one,
as the model covers the largest number of viruses. Fortunately, it is also the easiest to teach, having the clear connections to ball design and architecture.

<p>It also builds off the intuitive connection regarding the information conveyed by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWu7Yhp1r3Q'>the "shaking" demonstration</a>.
Here's a slide I like to show kids after showing them that:
<img src="whichSetOfPiecesAssembleFasterWhenCoveredWithMagnetsAndShaken.jpg" alt="Which assembles faster, when they are covered with magnets and shaken?" style="width:100%;">
If these two groups of six pieces had magnets attached to them like the virus pieces did, and they were shaken around in bags, which would assemble first?</p>
<p>The kids can all guess that the cube will assemble first.
This is a valuable connection to make - crystals and symmetrical protein structures like insulin assemble into patterned shapes for the same reason!
i.e. this is a deep insight into how things behave at the atomic level.</p>

<h3>"I want to teach a lesson involving the demos!"</h3>

<p>I have been thinking of making a version of my thing for integration into lessons, where the teacher plays with the thing.
If you want to do that, contact <a href='https://hamishtodd1.github.io'>me</a> and let me know and I will make it!</p>

<p>(and maybe you want to have all your students play with the things themselves.
Good luck to you if you try this - may the heavens smile on the computers or tablets that you supply the kids with)</p>

<h3>"I want to show that shaking toy thing"</h3>

<p>I recommend showing <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWu7Yhp1r3Q'>this video</a>.</p>

<p>Ah, but you're super keen and you want to do it with the actual toy? Well, to be honest, you're in for a world of pain!
<a href='http://www.sciencewithinreach.com/'>This</a> is the website I got it from, but they're almost always sold out.
And I had to pay import duty on it, which they refunded when I emailed them, but urgh.
Note that a "kit" has twelve pieces, which is enough to assemble a virus, but not enough to assemble one <em>in any reasonable length of time</em> (we did a bunch of takes to get the one you see in the video).
So I actually recommend getting two kits putting excess pieces in your shaking receptacle.</p>

<p>IF ANYONE KNOWS SOMEONE WORKING AT A TOY PRODUCTION COMPANY GET THEM ON THIS! It's just a few bits of plastic with magnets, it shouldn't cost nearly as much as it does!</p>

<h3>"I want to do a lesson in which my students make some origami"</h3>

<p>Making geometrical shapes out of origami is very fun and educational - though I'm afraid you need to be aware that it is time-consuming.
Small geometric shapes (cubes, tetrahedra, octahedra) are not too bad, but even the simplest origami virus model is moderately intricate, so you won't be able to get a student to make one in a lesson.
However - making an origami virus or two is a good fit for a classroom full of kids (age 7-11).</p>

<p>To do this though, it is very important that you understand the origami connection really really well yourself, because you may well get challenging questions.
Here is a lecture in which I go through the connection in more detail:</p>

<p>Note it leaves out the HIV folding algorithm thing.
As it says at 7:17, I recommend is making that virus, ("Feline Panleukopenia virus" - one of the viruses that cats need to get vaccinated against!), out of "sonobe units". These are extremely simple to fold, here are the instructions:</p>

<img src="sonobe.jpg" style="width:100%;">

<p>If you have not done this kind of origami before, to clarify your understanding, make a few of these yourself, say six, and put them toggether into some shape, say a cube. Congratulations on your first piece of "modular origami"!</p>

<p>Teach the kids to make that unit, maybe have them decorate theirs (but only on the side that has a cross on it!).
It takes 30 units to make Feline Panleukopenia virus. You will be the one to assemble it.</p>

<h3>"I want to do a lesson all about HIV/Polio/some other specific virus. What do I need to know in order to integrate information about its pattern?"</h3>

<p>The first thing to say is that viruses are very small, so for some viruses we know their shape (in the jargon: "the structure has been solved"), and for others we don't.
For example, if you want to do a lesson on hepatitis E, at the time I am writing this, there are no pictures for you! But most of the famous viruses are well-studied, so there are probably resources out there for you.</p>

<p>If you're interested in a particular virus that I didn't mention, it will fit into one of the four families I talk about. In descending order of likelihood, it could be
football-ish like hepatitis, blobby like Measles, Islamic art-ish like Zika, or irregular like HIV.
There is one family that I basically left out, because it's not *particularly* interesting in this context: "helical" viruses.
Ebola and Rabies are helical. <a href='https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/178'>Here's a great illustration of ebola</a>, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary_Axe'>this</a> is a building that is structured like a helical virus.</p>

<p>If you google image search the name of the virus followed by "capsid", with a bit of luck, the "structure" will have been "solved" and you will get pictures of it.</p>

<h3>"I want to show a 3D picture of some virus"</h3>
<p>This can be really worthwhile - viruses like what you get on google images are a bit hard to look at, and students might need convincing that it's "football shaped".
But *you will need to be a person who is experienced at downloading and working your way through whatever software you need to accomplish something*.
To do this I recommend <a href='https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html'>Chimera</a>.</p>

<h3>"I really liked that this was interactive! Are there any things like it that you'd recommend?"</h3>
<p>Yes! Go to explorableexplanations.com.</p>

<p>There are also some video games I would like to recommend. The craft of video game design is being refined, and the days of "chocolate covered broccoli" educational games is coming to an end.

<a href="http://www.testtubegames.com/bondbreaker.html"><em>Bond Breaker</em></a> and

People bang on about Minecraft too of course, which is a good game, but we can demand better things than Minecraft!
