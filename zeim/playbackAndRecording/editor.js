		Timeline
		Audio
		"clip maker"
		Grabbing start and end
		Superimposing words and pictures?
		little preview of the clip on the rectangle
		Two screens side by side:
		Multiple tracks

	You're going to use keyboard shortcuts anyway so not much need for buttons
	
	You can grab the ends and move them to change how much is there. Contract a line and it will "ripple" the gap shut
	Do want zooming and marks for seconds and minutes. And the ability to grab and move the timeline along
	Probably fine to only have editing be on the main timeline. So you start out by all the original pieces (possibly many copies) and putting them in order, then trimming them.
	Just display the pieces above the timeline, grab them when you please
	Probably want names for the various bits displayed on them

	would be nice if you could select some periods for gifs and have them automatically go to imgur
