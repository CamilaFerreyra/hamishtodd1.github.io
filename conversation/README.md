An attempt to formalize conversation

Reasons why this might be a good idea:
	With the thing that you said written down, you become more appreciative of your responsibility to argue for it in its precise terms
	Ooooor, at least, change the terms

Reasons why this is a bad idea:
	Language doesn't work this way
	To the extent that you are trying to keep track of a logical system, it's a trivial one

Specific use cases:
	Could be used to store the reasoning behind a bunch of decisions made by a team
