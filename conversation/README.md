An attempt to formalize conversation

Probably a terrible idea and language doesn't work this way

Reasons why this might be a good idea:
	With the thing that you said written down, you become more appreciative of your responsibility to argue for it in its precise terms
	Ooooor, at least, change the terms

Specific use cases:
	Could be used to store the reasoning behind a bunch of decisions made by a team
