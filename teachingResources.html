<p> First, I&#39;m glad you enjoyed the presentation and you want to spread this stuff around.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I taught maths for a while and I believe that this is great mathematics teaching material - it is applicable and it is beautiful!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;s the most worthwhile information for my students to know about virus patterns?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of the information you see in there, the &quot;hepatitis&quot; chapter is, in a sense, the most important one,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">as the model covers the largest number of viruses (60% of virus species), and it has the clearest connection to applications like ball design and architecture.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It also builds off the intuitive connection regarding the information conveyed by the &quot;shaking&quot; demonstration.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Here&#39;s a slide I like to show kids after showing them that:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">[slide]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If these two groups of six pieces had magnets attached to them like the virus pieces did, and they were shaken around in bags, which would assemble first?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The kids can all guess that the cube will assemble first. This is a valuable connection to make - crystals and symmetrical protein structures like insulin assemble into patterned shapes for the same reason!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I want to teach a lesson with me presenting the information and interacting with the demos&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Here is a stand-alone version of the interactive parts:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">[teacher version]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can see it on its own on this webpage. Sorry if it runs slowly on your hardware! To speed it up you could try decreasing your monitor resolution, or decreasing the size of the window.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Here is a &lt;em&gt;powerpoint presentation&lt;/em&gt; containing all the &quot;slides&quot; you see. To download it click &quot;file&quot;, then &quot;download as&quot;, then &quot;pptx&quot;. Mac equivalent?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you want to integrate the virus assembly shaking toy into a lesson, to be honest, you&#39;re in for a world of pain. You should probably just show this crappy video instead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you&#39;re really keen, this is the website I got it on. They&#39;re almost always sold out. I had to pay import duty on it, which they refunded when I emailed them, but urgh.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I actually recommend getting two of the things and putting excess pieces in your shaking receptacle to be sure that the shaking will cause the thing to assemble in a reasonable length of time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Toy producers: gap in the market alert!!!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I want to do a lesson in which my students interact with some of the demos&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Warning: this is an idea that makes sense to me, but I have not actually tried it. Good luck to anyone who does - may the heavens smile on the computers or tablets that you supply the kids with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Here are separate pages for the different demos, as you will probably want to space them out:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hepatitis / Polio / Yellow Fever / common cold /etc</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Zika Virus / HPV</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">HIV</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I want to do a lesson in which my students make some origami&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Making geometrical shapes out of origami is very fun and educational - though I&#39;m afraid you need to be aware that it is time-consuming.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Small geometric shapes (cubes, tetrahedra, octahedra) are not too bad, but even the simplest origami virus model is moderately intricate, so you won&#39;t be able to get a student to make one in a lesson.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However - making an origami virus or two is a good fit for a classroom full of kids (age 7-11). This is another lesson plan I have not tried but which could be great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To do this though, it is very important that you understand the origami connection really really well yourself, because you may well get challenging questions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Here is a lecture in which I go through the connection in more detail (althugh it leaves out the HIV folding algorithm thing):</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">[lecture]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As it says in the lecture at BLAH TIME, what I recommend is making that virus, (&quot;&quot; - one of the viruses that cats need to get vaccinated against!), out of &quot;sonobe units&quot;. These are extremely simple to fold, here are the instructions:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">[instructions]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you have not done this kind of origami before, to clarify your understanding, make a few of these yourself, say six, and put them toggether into some shape, say a cube. Congratulations on your first piece of &quot;modular origami&quot;!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Teach the kids to make that unit, maybe have them decorate theirs (but only on the side that has a cross on it!). It takes 30 units to make BLAH virus. You will be the one to assemble it. When made of A4 it is an impressive sight!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I want to do a lesson all about [insert virus name here]. What do I need to know in order to integrate information about its pattern?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first thing to say is that viruses are very small, so for some viruses we know their shape (in the jargon: &quot;the structure has been solved&quot;), and for others we don&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For example, if you want to do a lesson on hepatitis E, at the time I am writing this, there are no pictures for you! But most of the famous viruses are well-studied, so there are probably resources out there for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you&#39;re interested in a particular virus that I didn&#39;t mention, it will fit into one of the four families I talk about. In descending order of likelihood, it could be</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">football-ish like hepatitis, blobby like Measles, Islamic art-ish like Zika, or irregular like HIV.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There is one family that I basically left out, because it&#39;s not *particularly* interesting in this context: &quot;helical&quot; viruses. Ebola and Rabies are helical. Here&#39;s a great illustration of ebola, and here&#39;s a building that is structured like a helical virus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you google image search the name of the virus followed by &quot;capsid&quot;, with a bit of luck, the &quot;structure&quot; will have been &quot;solved&quot; and you will get pictures of it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You can make super customized images or show your virus to students in 3D too if you want, and this can be worthwhile because lots of the images you will find will not suit your purposes!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But *you will need to be a person who is experienced at downloading and working your way through whatever software you need to accomplish something*.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To do this I recommend installing Chimera. Then you can try to find a structure of your virus. There are various formats the file could be in. In the likely event that it is &quot;.pdb&quot;, this webpage can help you out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Is there more stuff like this out there?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes! I recommend explorableexplanations.com.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There are also some video games I would like to recommend. The craft of video game design is being refined, and the days of &quot;chocolate covered broccoli&quot; educational games is coming to an end.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.incredipede.com/buy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incredipede&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lt;a href=&quot;http://miegakuregame.com&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miegakure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lt;a href=&quot;http://dragonbox.com/products/elements&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragonbox: Elements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.testtubegames.com/bondbreaker.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bond Breaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are especially great.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">People bang on about Minecraft too of course, which is a good game, but we can demand better things than Minecraft!</span></p>
