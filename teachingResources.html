<p> Hello!
First, I'm glad you enjoyed the presentation and you want to spread this stuff around.
I taught maths for a while and I believe that this is great mathematics teaching material - it is applicable and it is beautiful!

"What's the most worthwhile information for my students to know about virus patterns?"
Of the information you see in there, the "hepatitis" chapter is, in a sense, the most important one,
as the model covers the largest number of viruses (60% of virus species), and it has the clearest connection to applications like ball design and architecture.

It also builds off the intuitive connection regarding the information conveyed by the "shaking" demonstration.
Here's a slide I like to show kids after showing them that:
[slide]
If these two groups of six pieces had magnets attached to them like the virus pieces did, and they were shaken around in bags, which would assemble first?
The kids can all guess that the cube will assemble first. This is a valuable connection to make - crystals and symmetrical protein structures like insulin assemble into patterned shapes for the same reason!

"I want to teach a lesson with me presenting the information and interacting with the demos"

Here is a stand-alone version of the interactive parts:
[teacher version]

You can see it on its own on this webpage. Sorry if it runs slowly on your hardware! To speed it up you could try decreasing your monitor resolution, or decreasing the size of the window.

Here is a <em>powerpoint presentation</em> containing all the "slides" you see. To download it click "file", then "download as", then "pptx". Mac equivalent?

If you want to integrate the virus assembly shaking toy into a lesson, to be honest, you're in for a world of pain. You should probably just show this crappy video instead.

If you're really keen, this is the website I got it on. They're almost always sold out. I had to pay import duty on it, which they refunded when I emailed them, but urgh.
I actually recommend getting two of the things and putting excess pieces in your shaking receptacle to be sure that the shaking will cause the thing to assemble in a reasonable length of time.

Toy producers: gap in the market alert!!!

"I want to do a lesson in which my students interact with some of the demos"

Warning: this is an idea that makes sense to me, but I have not actually tried it. Good luck to anyone who does - may the heavens smile on the computers or tablets that you supply the kids with.

Here are separate pages for the different demos, as you will probably want to space them out:
Hepatitis / Polio / Yellow Fever / common cold /etc
Zika Virus / HPV
HIV

"I want to do a lesson in which my students make some origami"

Making geometrical shapes out of origami is very fun and educational - though I'm afraid you need to be aware that it is time-consuming.
Small geometric shapes (cubes, tetrahedra, octahedra) are not too bad, but even the simplest origami virus model is moderately intricate, so you won't be able to get a student to make one in a lesson.
However - making an origami virus or two is a good fit for a classroom full of kids (age 7-11). This is another lesson plan I have not tried but which could be great.

To do this though, it is very important that you understand the origami connection really really well yourself, because you may well get challenging questions.
Here is a lecture in which I go through the connection in more detail (althugh it leaves out the HIV folding algorithm thing):
[lecture]

As it says in the lecture at BLAH TIME, what I recommend is making that virus, ("" - one of the viruses that cats need to get vaccinated against!), out of "sonobe units". These are extremely simple to fold, here are the instructions:
[instructions]

If you have not done this kind of origami before, to clarify your understanding, make a few of these yourself, say six, and put them toggether into some shape, say a cube. Congratulations on your first piece of "modular origami"!

Teach the kids to make that unit, maybe have them decorate theirs (but only on the side that has a cross on it!). It takes 30 units to make BLAH virus. You will be the one to assemble it. When made of A4 it is an impressive sight!

"I want to do a lesson all about [insert virus name here]. What do I need to know in order to integrate information about its pattern?"

The first thing to say is that viruses are very small, so for some viruses we know their shape (in the jargon: "the structure has been solved"), and for others we don't.
For example, if you want to do a lesson on hepatitis E, at the time I am writing this, there are no pictures for you! But most of the famous viruses are well-studied, so there are probably resources out there for you.

If you're interested in a particular virus that I didn't mention, it will fit into one of the four families I talk about. In descending order of likelihood, it could be
football-ish like hepatitis, blobby like Measles, Islamic art-ish like Zika, or irregular like HIV.
There is one family that I basically left out, because it's not *particularly* interesting in this context: "helical" viruses. Ebola and Rabies are helical. Here's a great illustration of ebola, and here's a building that is structured like a helical virus.

If you google image search the name of the virus followed by "capsid", with a bit of luck, the "structure" will have been "solved" and you will get pictures of it.
You can make super customized images or show your virus to students in 3D too if you want, and this can be worthwhile because lots of the images you will find will not suit your purposes!
But *you will need to be a person who is experienced at downloading and working your way through whatever software you need to accomplish something*.
To do this I recommend installing Chimera. Then you can try to find a structure of your virus. There are various formats the file could be in. In the likely event that it is ".pdb", this webpage can help you out.

"Is there more stuff like this out there?"
Yes! I recommend explorableexplanations.com.

There are also some video games I would like to recommend. The craft of video game design is being refined, and the days of "chocolate covered broccoli" educational games is coming to an end.

<a href="http://dragonbox.com/products/elements"><em>Dragonbox: Elements</em></a>, and
<a href="http://www.testtubegames.com/bondbreaker.html"><em>Bond Breaker</em></a> are especially great.
People bang on about Minecraft too of course, which is a good game, but we can demand better things than Minecraft!
